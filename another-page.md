## Personal project and fun 

This is mainly coding related projects I have worked on in my free time, I have been quite busy so some of my code is quite old and needs reformatting as it is ugly. 


- [Procsess injection example] (https://github.com/HBLocker/procsss-Injection/blob/master/README.md)

I decided to do a little project a few years back on injecting into a procsess to see how it works as I wanted to understand more on malicious code. 


- [SALSA and CHACHA] (https://github.com/HBLocker/Salsa-ChaCha)


I began to really enjoy reading papers and want to understand them more so I chose to write these in c, they are not 100% accurate with thier outputs but it is somewhat an example of how they work. Please dont use them for any real world project that would be silly now. 


- [Hash Based Signatures] (https://github.com/HBLocker/Hash-Based-Signatures)

I was reading a paper on this and deicded to try implement it based from the paper. I will add a write up soon ish. 



- [Nural Network IDS]  (https://github.com/HBLocker/NuralNetwork-Network-traffic)
Part of a uni project.
