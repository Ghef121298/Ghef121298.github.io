## Personal project and fun 


This is mainly coding related projects I have worked on in my free time, I have been quite busy so some of my code is quite old.  


### Kyber OpenSSL

I starteed adding kyber into OpenSSL and Plan to do a write up at some point. Fork of OpenSSL. 
- [Openssl_kyber](https://github.com/HBLocker/openssl-1)





### Hash Based Signature
- [Hash Based Signatures](https://github.com/HBLocker/Hash-Based-Signatures)

I was reading a paper on this and deicded to try implement it based from the paper. I will add a write up soon. 


#### SALSA and CHACH 
- [SALSA and CHACHA](https://github.com/HBLocker/Salsa-ChaCha)


I began to really enjoy reading papers and want to understand them more so I chose to write these in c, they are not 100% accurate with thier outputs but it is somewhat an example of how they work. Please dont use them for any real world project that would be silly now. 



#### Procsess injection
-  [Procsess injection example](https://github.com/HBLocker/procsss-Injection/blob/master/README.md)


#### Nural Network IDS

 - [Nural Network IDS](https://github.com/HBLocker/NuralNetwork-Network-traffic)
 
 Old uni project on creating a IDS using machine learning, there is a report in there, it is not very good as I was heavily sleep deprived from writing my dissertation and began work at RHUL.
