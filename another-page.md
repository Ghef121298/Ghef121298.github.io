## Personal project and fun 




I decided to do a little project a few years back on injecting into a procsess to see how it works as I wanted to understand more on malicious code. 

### Hash Based Signature
[Hash Based Signatures](https://github.com/HBLocker/Hash-Based-Signatures)

I was reading a paper on this and deicded to try implement it based from the paper. I will add a write up soon. 


#### SALSA and CHACH 
[SALSA and CHACHA](https://github.com/HBLocker/Salsa-ChaCha)


I began to really enjoy reading papers and want to understand them more so I chose to write these in c, they are not 100% accurate with thier outputs but it is somewhat an example of how they work. Please dont use them for any real world project that would be silly now. 



This is mainly coding related projects I have worked on in my free time, I have been quite busy so some of my code is quite old.

#### Nural Network IDS

 Old uni project on creating a IDS using machine learning, there is a report in there, it is not very good as I was heavily sleep deprived from writing my dissertation and began work at RHUL.
