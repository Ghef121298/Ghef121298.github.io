                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a PhD candidate at the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM). I am part of the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) research group at Queen Mary University of London. 
                    
                    My research interests include Optical Music Recognition as well as other MIR-related subfields. My goal is to have computers read sheet music computationally. I started working on this problem in September 2019 when I was granted the studentship from QMUL and Steinberg GmBH, with whom we collaborate closely. 
                    
                    I am also the founder and a steering committee member of the <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/ai-and-ethics/" target="_blank">QMUL AI and Ethics Research Group</a>. This group critically examines the ethical dimensions of AI, with a focus on ensuring responsible and inclusive AI applications. The group organizes interdisciplinary seminars, collaborative workshops, and research projects that explore topics such as fairness, accountability, transparency, and the societal implications of AI technologies.
