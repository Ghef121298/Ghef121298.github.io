# WikiPathways

<p><a href="http://www.wikipathways.org" target="_blank">WikiPathways</a> is an open collaborative platform dedicated to the curation of biological pathways. WikiPathways presents a new model for pathway databases that enhances and complements ongoing efforts, such as <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc/" target="_blank">Pathway Commons</a>, <a href="http://reactome.org/" target="_blank">Reactome</a> and <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/" target="_blank">KEGG</a>.</p>

<p>Why pathways? Strictly speaking, one could argue that pathways don't exist... there are only networks. Nonetheless, pathways are useful. Biological pathways provide intuitive views of the myriad of interactions underlying biological processes.</p>

<p>WikiPathways team works on enabling storing diagrams in the <a href="http://sbgn.github.io/sbgn/" target="_blank">Systems Biology Graphical Notation</a> standard to make possible using WikiPathways as a collaborative environment for exchange, comparison and improvement of disease map modules.</p>

<p>Together with many other collaborators, the Disease Maps Project and WikiPathways work on the concept of reusable modules for efficient collaboration and avoiding duplicated efforts.</p>
