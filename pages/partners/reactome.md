# Reactome

[Reactome](https://reactome.org/) is a free, open-source, open data, curated and peer-reviewed pathway database. The goal is to provide intuitive bioinformatics tools for visualization, interpretation and analysis of pathway knowledge to support basic research, genome analysis, modelling, systems biology and education.  

Within the partnership of the Reactome and the Disease Maps, the shared areas of interest identified include modular approach and hierarchically organised content, visualisation and “human-like” automatic layout algorithms, data interpretation and modelling.
