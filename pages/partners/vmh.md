# Virtual Metabolic Human


The [Virtual Metabolic Human](https://www.vmh.life/) (VMH, Noronha et al, 2019, PMID [30371894](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371894)) is a resource that can explicitly link human metabolism, gut microbiome metabolism, nutrition, and disease. VMH integrates and maintains relations between these entities:  

* global reconstruction of human metabolism Recon3 (Brunk et al., 2018, PMID [29457794](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29457794));  
* metabolic reconstructions of gut microbes (Magnúsdóttir et al., 2017, PMID [27893703](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27893703));  
* data for more than 200 metabolic diseases (Sahoo and Thiele, 2013, PMID [23492669](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23492669));  
* dietary information.  

Considering the increasing complexity of metabolic networks, tools that enable to interactively visualize metabolic network content and integrate omics data and simulation results are highly desirable. [ReconMaps](http://vmh.uni.lu/#reconmap) (Noronha et al., 2016, PMID [27993782](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993782); Noronha et al, 2019, PMID [30371894](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371894)) is a collection of manually drawn comprehensive maps, consistent with the content of Recon3, and is available through a [web interface](https://vmh.uni.lu/MapViewer/index.xhtml) that allows content query, visualization of custom datasets and submission of feedback to manual curators. An extension of the [Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis](https://opencobra.github.io/) (COBRA) toolbox (Heirendt et al., 2019, PMID [30787451](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30787451)) was developed to interact with ReconMap and allows users to directly upload simulation results to ReconMaps.

[VMH](http://vmh.life/) and [ReconMaps](http://vmh.uni.lu/#reconmap) can be connected to disease-specific maps, such as the [Parkinson’s disease map](http://disease-maps.org/projects/parkinsons), thereby enabling investigations beyond metabolic pathways.
