# Physiome Project

<p>The term "physiome" comes from "physio" (life) + "ome" (as a whole), and is intended to provide a "quantitative description of physiological dynamics and functional behaviour of the intact organism".</p>

<p>The <a href="http://physiomeproject.org/" target="_blank">Physiome Project</a> develops a multi-scale modelling framework for understanding physiological function that allows models to be combined and linked in a hierarchical fashion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cellml.org/" target="_blank">CellML</a> and <a href="http://physiomeproject.org/software/fieldml/about" target="_blank">FieldML</a> formats are used to store and exchange computer-based mathematical models in a reproducible and reusable manner.</p>

<p>All software tools (including APIs, authoring tools, visualization tools, graphical user interfaces, and simulation tools) developed for the Physiome Project are open source, using commercially friendly licenses (a commercial package, for example, can link the open-source libraries).</p>

<p>In partnership with the Disease Maps Project, the Physiome Project aims to explore the modular approach for building disease models and investigate how CellML and SBGN formats can interoperate efficiently. The <a href="http://disease-maps.org/projects/acutekidneyinjury">acute kidney injury</a> project is chosen as the pilot one: an agreement on collaboration is reached with the <a href="https://trecard.com/akiprev-project/" target="_blank">AKIPREV</a> leaders.</p>
