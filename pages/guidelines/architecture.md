# Designing map architecture

We propose to design a map starting with a single diagram in SBGN Process Description (PD) or SBGN Activity Flow (AF) and gradually creating a more advanced architecture. This way each version of the map is a fully functional resource ready exploration and applications. The multi-layered structure with multiple maps in PD and AF layers aims to solve the complexity management problem when the network becomes increasingly more extensive and hard to manage.

### Recommended design options

More than one approch is possible. Depending on a project it is recommended to start from a single PD diagram and step by step build a multi-layered structure. In case of extensive coverage of biological functions or limited resorses it might be more efficient to start from an AF diagram and a top-level view.
