This section is in preparation. Brief introduction. What is knowledge formalisation. Initial consideration.

### PubMed search

This section is in preparation. Example search.

### Figure search

This section is in preparation. Example search. Preference to figures from journal articles.

### Figure to SBGN

This section is in preparation. Useful resource: [Figure to SBGN](https://sbgn.github.io/figuretosbgn)

### Text to SBGN

This section is in preparation. How to draw an initial diagram based on the text, how to examine the diagram and ask questions, how to identify missing information (missing transport when connectors cross subcellular locations, unclear state of an active enzyme - phosphorylated, maybe dimer), and how to find missing information in other publications.

### Reusing information from pathway databases

This section is in preparation. Example of contextualisation.
