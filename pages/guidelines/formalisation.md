In the context of developing disease maps, "knowledge formalisation" refers to the practice of transforming textual information and figures in publications to the structured format of the [Systems Biology Graphical Notation](https://sbgn.github.io/) (SBGN) standard ([PMID: 19668183](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19668183)). Scattered information about disease mechanisms from hundreds of scientific articles is integrated into a single conceptual disease model.

### PubMed search

This section is in preparation. Example search.

To organise reference, a reference manager such as Zotero can be used. It is well-integrated in various browsers and papers can be easily saved individually or in bulk. Introductions to Zotero functionalities are available at many university websites and easy to find. One useful functionality is a shared library many users can access. We also suggest creating folders and subfolders for references. They work as tags and one paper can appear is several folders. This way, when revisiting, during map development and annotation, it is easier to find publications relevant to a certain topic or a subpathway.

### Figure search

Figures in published articles are a special and very useful resource for developing disease maps. While they are not in a standard or machine-readable format, the understading of mechanisms is often very well conveyed and there is a lot of work and expertise behind these conceptual representations and graphical summaries. A good figure from a review paper can be the key starting point for creating a disease map or a top-level overview layer of a disease map.

[PMC Image Search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) is a good way to find such figures in PubMed Central. The way it works is described, for example, on pages of the [UAMS Library](https://libguides.uams.edu/image-resources/pmc) and the [University of Pittsburgh Library](https://info.hsls.pitt.edu/updatereport/2011/october-2011/need-images-try-pubmed-central/). 

[Google Images Search](https://images.google.com/) is another quick and convenient search. For example, search for "asthma mechanisms" will immediately offer relevant images from scientific publications. Adding "nature.com" to the search will narrow it down to publication in Nature journals. 

Another interesting resource is the [Cell SnapShot](https://www.cell.com/snapshots) archive with many useful visualisations including those dedicated to various diseases. 

### Figure to SBGN

### Text to SBGN

This section is in preparation. How to draw an initial diagram based on the text, how to examine the diagram and ask questions, how to identify missing information (missing transport when connectors cross subcellular locations, unclear state of an active enzyme - phosphorylated, maybe dimer), and how to find missing information in other publications.

### Reusing information from pathway databases

This section is in preparation. Example of contextualisation.
