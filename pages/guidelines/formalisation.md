This section is in preparation. Brief introduction. What is knowledge formalisation. Initial consideration.

### PubMed search

This section is in preparation. Example search.

### Figure search

Figures in published articles are a special very useful resource for developing disease maps. While they are not in a standard or machine-readable format, the understadning of mechanisms is often very well conveyed and there is a lot of work and expertise behind these conceptual representations and graphical summaries. A good figure from a review paper can be the key starting point for creating a disease map or a top-level overview layer of a disease map.

One of possible ways to find such figures from publications is to use [PMC Image Search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) as described, for example, on pages of the [UAMS Library](https://libguides.uams.edu/image-resources/pmc) and the [University of Pittsburgh Library](https://info.hsls.pitt.edu/updatereport/2011/october-2011/need-images-try-pubmed-central/). Another quick and convenient search is [Google Images Search](https://images.google.com/). For example Google Image Search for "asthma mechanisms" will immediatly offer relevant images from scrientific publications. Adding "nature.com" to the search will narrow it dowin to publication in Nature journals. 

Another interesting resource is [Cell SnapShot](https://www.cell.com/snapshots) archive with many useful visualisations including those dedicated to various diseses. 

### Figure to SBGN

This section is in preparation. Useful resource: [Figure to SBGN](https://sbgn.github.io/figuretosbgn)

### Text to SBGN

This section is in preparation. How to draw an initial diagram based on the text, how to examine the diagram and ask questions, how to identify missing information (missing transport when connectors cross subcellular locations, unclear state of an active enzyme - phosphorylated, maybe dimer), and how to find missing information in other publications.

### Reusing information from pathway databases

This section is in preparation. Example of contextualisation.
