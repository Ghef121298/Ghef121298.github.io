This document is intended as a template for planning the content of a disease map. It can be adjusted to a specifc case depending on the topic, project objectives and input from domain experts. The overal purpose of this document is to help to start map development by focusing on priority pathways and by quickly organising initial information. It can be maintained throughout the project or discontinued as soon as more advanced management tools are used, for example, a map in MINERVA with a possibility of exporting all molecules and interactions included, analytical tools, Neo4j Graph Database for advanced access and management, list of pathways included, etc.

### Disease identifiers

Disease identifiers can be searched via the Disease Ontology (https://disease-ontology.org). For example, for asthma: DOID:2841, EFO:0000270, GARD:10246, ICD10CM:J45, ICD9CM:493, KEGG:05310, MESH:D001249, NCI:C28397, OMIM:600807, UMLS_CUI:C0004096. For allergic asthma as a subtype of asthma: DOID:9415, ICD10CM:J45, ICD9CM:493.0, UMLS_CUI:C0155877. 

### Related diseases

Working with diseese identifiers might help to determine the focus of the map, explore related diseases and comorbidies. For example, for asthma, related diseases are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obesity, and also the diseases of the “atopic march” - progression from atopic dermatitis to allergic rhinitis and asthma. Parasite infections can be studied in connection to asthma to understand the role of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in asthma. Knowing the topic in perspective can lead to interesting hypotheses and collaborative projects. 

### Suggested search terms

List of initial search terms suggested by the experts or identified after reading key review papers.

### Organs, tissues and cell types involved

Text

### Pathways involved

At initial stages it is important to identify priority pathways to start developing the map while more information is collected and the mad design is determined.

### Molecules involved

Molecules involved can be found and prioritised accournding to the literature. Also, databases such as Open Targets Platform (https://platform.opentargets.org). For example, for allergic asthma: https://platform.opentargets.org/disease/MONDO_0004784/associations.

### Aetiology

### Disease mechanisms: modules/hallmarks to include

### Outcomes

Text

### Treatment

Relevant treatment is to be llisted, especially medication that is routinely prescribed, continuously used by patients and therefore is likely to affect disease mechanisms.

### Recovery mechanisms
