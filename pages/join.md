# Get involved

<p>We are actively expanding the list of diseases covered by the Disease Maps Project and are looking for new 
contributors interested in molecular mechanisms of diseases: computational biology teams working on disease models 
and clinicians or experimental biologists who would like to contribute as domain experts. If you are working on one of the 
diseases which are already listed on this website, please do not be discouraged: we would be happy to collaborate and integrate 
your work in the overall effort.</p>

<h3>Computational biology groups</h3>
<p>We invite to collaborate groups that work on the reconstruction of disease mechanisms. The framework of the community 
effort is very practical and allows each involved group execute their tasks with better efficiency, save time and resources. 
Together we optimise analytical methods, 'omics data interpretation approaches, share experience in modelling and improve 
hypothesis generation pipelines.</p>

<h3>Disease domain experts</h3>
<p>Clinicians and biologists with an extensive expertise in a particular disease are welcome to participate in building 
reference resources that describe disease mechanisms. The protocols we use allow very efficient 
communication with domain experts while asking for minimal time to be dedicated to it.</p>

<h3>Pathway domain experts</h3>
<p>If your research is related to metabolic or signalling pathways and you are interested in sharing your expertise 
via unambiguously drawn machine-readable diagrams, please contact us. We believe that the next-generation 
high-quality pathway modules should be designed and continuously updated by top experts in the corresponding domains.</p>
