## imSAVAR Symposium: Mapping the immune system effects of immunomodulatory therapies

### Disease Maps as computational knowledge repository of immune system effects of immunomodulatory therapies

Kristin Reiche, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI, Department of Diagnostics, Germany

The EU funded project [imSAVAR](https://imsavar.eu/) (Immune safety avatar: Nonclinical mimicking of the immune system effects of immunomodulatory therapies) develops a platform to improve the prediction of potential side effects and thereby the safety and efficacy of immunomodulatory therapeutics. imSAVAR utilizes irAOPs (immune-related adverse outcome pathways) to describe the sequential order of key events, test systems as well as related molecules that result in an immune-related adverse outcome. In the symposium we give an overview of imSAVARâ€™s guidelines and methods to use Disease Maps as a computational knowledge repository of irAOPs, and provide insights in identified challenges and possible solutions of thereof.
