**<a target="_blank" href="https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter?t=15:00&tz=Berlin">15:00</a> Breakout Session 1**
<br>
_(two topics in parallel)_
#### Topic 1:
**Need and approaches to connect various disease maps**
<br>**Description**: Several disease maps are in the public domain providing a comprehensive knowledge base around their indications. The knowledge base available with one disease map can also be used to quickly curate and annotate another disease map. There exist many redundancies in the curated processes and molecular interactions. Systems medicine disease map currently lists 16 disease map projects. A solution to search for cells, molecules, and processes among all Disease Maps (and maybe even other Databases) could improve map curation and connect efforts between different research groups.
<br>
#### Topic 2:
**Disease maps from knowledgebase to analysis platform**
<br>**Description**: In most cases, disease maps are in the form of a static knowledge base with linkages to various state-of-the-art databases or mapping of the experimental data in the form of visual overlays. Disease maps should be used not only for the knowledge representation but also as the analysis platform. 
In this breakout room, we will discuss recent efforts to make disease maps as an analysis platform. We will also discuss potential areas where disease maps can serve as a powerful tool for the generation of data-driven hypotheses.

<br>
_(two topics in parallel)_
#### Topic 3:
**Bringing disease maps close to clinics**
<br>**Description**: Ideally, disease maps will eventually be used to stratify patient cohorts and/or predict whether a patient falls into group “disease” or group “control”. Currently, disease maps can serve as a visualization tool for patient data visualization based on patient demographics. Workflows to extend this functionality of disease maps for clinicians have been suggested. In this session, we will discuss recent advances and open tasks to reach this goal.
<br>
#### Topic 4:
**Challenges in Disease Maps Curation**
<br>**Description**: There is a certain standard workflow to the curation of disease maps. However, as disease maps are constructed with a certain disease/question in mind, challenges for curators arise, which affect the reusability of disease maps. The different questions disease maps are based on lead to variations of the disease map construction and curation workflow. Presently these deviations are not tracked in an all encompassing navigable manner. Further, standard network analysis workflows are usually based on either using “activity flow” or “process description” SBGN languages. Disease maps often use a mix of the two, making the establishment of adjusted analysis tools/workflows necessary. With time our understanding of disease pathology increases, hence disease maps need constant updates. Currently, this is done manually. As this is both labour and time consuming, a more streamlined solution would be advantageous. Finally, most computational models require experimental validation, before they are accepted by the research community. As of now, no general recommendations for experimental validations are available. This session will be used to exchange ideas and experiences encountered during map curation. Defining a general solution is often not possible. However, it may be beneficial to keep track of experiences and solutions, beyond DMCMs.
