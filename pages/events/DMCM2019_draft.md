### Afternoon discussion sessions

Afternoon breakout discussion sessions are planned following the example of the [2nd Disease Maps Community Meeting](http://disease-maps.org/DMCM2017_2nd) in Luxembourg. We invite proposals: a title and a brief description of the topic (1 page maximum). 4-6 topics will be selected, introduced 2nd October and discussed 3rd and 4th October with summaries presented at the end to all the participants. The outcome of the Luxembourg meeting discussions was published receintly in _Briefings in Bioinformatics_: [doi: 10.1093/bib/bby024](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bby024).
