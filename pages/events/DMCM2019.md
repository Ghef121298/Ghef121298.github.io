## Programme

### Invited talks

**Logic modeling to integrate disease maps and various omics data**  
Julio Saez-Rodriguez, RWTH-Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany

**Toward whole-cell computational models for precision medicine**  
Jonathan Karr, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, US

### Afternoon discussion sessions

Afternoon breakout discussion sessions are planned following the example of the [2nd Disease Maps Community Meeting](http://disease-maps.org/DMCM2017_2nd) in Luxembourg. We invite proposals: a title and a breif description of the topic (1 page maximum). 4-6 topics will be selected, introduced 2nd October and discussed 3rd and 4th October with summaries presented at the end to all the participants. The outcome of the Luxembourg meeting discussions was published receintly in *Briefings in Bioinformatics*: [doi: 10.1093/bib/bby024](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bby024).
