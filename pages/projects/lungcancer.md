# Lung cancer

## Lung Cancer Disease Map (LCDMap)

Chronic diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD) affect half of the population over 50 in Western Europe 
([WHO Global Report, 2005](http://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/contents/en/)). The accumulation of chronic diseases across life shapes health trajectories, influenced and curbed by heterogeneous environmental, social or lifestyle factors. The unfortunate outcome of the trajectories can lead to cancer events (e.g. non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC). Even though the mechanisms involved in COPD or NSCLC are well investigated (for example, Gomez-Cabrero et al., 2013, [PMID 25472826](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25472826); CLCGP and NGM, 2013, [PMID 24174329](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24174329)), the molecular events occurring during the transition between COPD and NSCLC are yet to be clarified. The Lung Cancer Disease Map intends to focus on the numerous molecular mechanisms and pathway dysregulations involved in NSCLC, and investigate the unfortunate transition from COPD to NSCLC.  

<Diagram reconstruction of interrelations and interconnections between the molecular entities involved in this specific context is a practical yet challenging mean to sew the pieces of knowledge together and acquire a clear and exhaustive understanding of the whole picture. Moreover, the trajectory notion with time-related points is an opportunity to implement a representation of network dynamics, based on successive stages, to highlight pertinent modifications during disease transition.  

Launched from joint efforts between the <a href="https://iab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/" target="_blank">Institute for Advanced Biosciences</a> (IAB), the <a href="http://www.eisbm.org/" target="_blank">European Institute for Systems Biology and Medicine</a> (EISBM) and the <a href="http://scsb.sjtu.edu.cn/xtswyx/homeen.do?method=getHomeList" target="_blank">Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine</a> (SCSB), and supported by the regional cancer organisation <a href="http://www.canceropole-clara.com/" target="_blank">Canceropole Lyon Auvergne Rhone Alpes</a> (CLARA) this project features international-level expertise on COPD and lung cancer, and initiated a strong collaboration with the <a href="https://sysbio.curie.fr/" target="_blank">Computational Systems Biology of Cancer</a> group from Institut Curie within the Disease Maps Community.
