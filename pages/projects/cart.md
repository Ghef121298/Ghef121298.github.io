### Description

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), or chimeric immunoreceptor, or chimeric T cell receptor is an artificial T cell receptor protein engineered to give T cells an ability to target a specific antigen. This receptor type is named chimeric because it combines antigen-binding and T-cell-activating functions. CAR T-Cell therapy is a form of immunotherapy that uses T cells engineered with CARs to treat cancer. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most common type of toxicity caused by CAR T cell therapy.
