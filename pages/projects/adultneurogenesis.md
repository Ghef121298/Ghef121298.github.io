# Adult neurogenesis

## The Cognitive Resilience Map

Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus provides a source of cellular plasticity that appears to contribute to a 'cognitive reserve' helping to buffer against cognitive decline even in cases of neuronal loss. The process of adult neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from a neuronal stem cell pool, involves multiple cell types and sub-processes each of which is sensitive to a different combination of environmental influences. The Cognitive Resilience Map project aims to collate the molecular, cellular, behavioural and environmental factors associated with adult neurogenesis into a formal interaction model to aid future research in the field.
