Meniere’s disease 

Meniere’s disease Map

Meniere’s disease (MD) is an inner ear syndrome defined by three major symptoms: episodic vertigo, tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss involving low and medium frequencies. The disorder is explained by the accumulation of endolymph with increased pressure in the cochlear duct (endolymphatic hydrops), which damages the organ of Corti. 
The condition shows a great clinical heterogeneity with large differences in response to therapy and clinical variants with different mechanisms have been proposed such as autoimmunity or autoinflammation.

The majority of cases are considered sporadic, although familial aggregation has been recognized and few genes have been described in autosomal dominant families. Detailed phenotyping and cluster analyses have found several clinical predictors for different subgroups of patients, which may indicate different mechanisms, including genetic and immune factors. So far, two mechanisms have been involved in MD: a) a pro-inflammatory immune response mediated by IL-1β TNFα and IL-6, suggesting an autoinflammatory process and b) an endophenotype found in 18% of patients with autoimmune MD defined by an NFkB-mediated inflammation in the carriers of the single nucleotide variant rs4947296.

The objectives are:
1. To develop an integrated molecular network (MDmap) which include different MD mechanisms.
2. To conduct network-based analysis, interpretation and generation of novel hyphotheses.
3. To define endophenotypes according to specific mechanisms of disease.

The starting point of the MDmap will be the autoimmune MDmap, based on gene expression datasets obtained from PBMC from patients with MD. An initial version of the MD map which is related to autoimmune processes could be found at https://mdmap.lcsb.uni.lu/minerva/ 


The MDmap is being developed in close collaboration with the LCSB Parkinson's disease map team. MINERVA platform is employed for online visualisation.
