# Rheumatoid arthritis
## Rheumatoid Arthritis Map (RA-MAP)

The [University of Evry](http://www.univ-evry.fr/en/), Paris Saclay is working on an updated, detailed, fully annotated molecular map for RA based on exhaustive curation of the existing literature using CellDesigner. This map will serve as a template for the construction of a qualitative dynamical model, in order to explore the dynamical properties of the system and analyze its underlying regulatory networks. The model will then be used to address different biological questions such as comparing the network for different phenotypes, trying to understand the mechanisms driving variable responses to treatment and investigating the role of co- and multi-morbidities.

The construction of a map and of a dynamic model are two tasks with different purposes that are today mainly performed in an independent way. On the one hand, it is a question of creating a knowledge base in the form of a map, and on the other of defining an abstraction of the system that captures dynamic behaviours of interest. Yet these two constructs share a lot of information, including the mode of influence (e.g., activation or inhibition) and the topology of the network.

In order to bridge the gap between static and dynamic representations, the team has developed CaSQ (CellDesigner as SBML-qual), a tool for automated inference of large Boolean models, from molecular interaction maps based on network topology and semantics.

The large scale Boolean models produced can be simulated and modelled using the [Cell Collective](https://cellcollective.org/) modelling platform.
