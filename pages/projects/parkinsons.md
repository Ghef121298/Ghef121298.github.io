# Parkinson’s disease

## [Parkinson’s Disease Map](https://pdmap.uni.lu/minerva/)

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world. Although many genetic and 
environmental factors contributing to the risk of PD have been identified, no unique causal mechanism is defined. 
Information on various aspects of PD pathogenesis is rapidly increasing and needs to be efficiently organized to make this 
knowledge available for researchers from academia, clinics and pharma industry.</p>

<p>With our partners at the <a href="http://www.sbi.jp/" target="_blank">Systems Biology Institute</a> (SBI) in Tokyo, Japan, 
we have developed the <a href="http://pdmap.uni.lu" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease map</a> (PD map) - the first manually curated and high-quality knowledge repository of 
molecular mechanisms contributing to the complex aetiology of PD. The map compiles information from more than 1000 research 
articles and public databases into a molecular interaction map.</p>

<p>The PD map displays molecular and biochemical pathways from human brain focused on dopaminergic neurons, including the direct 
cellular environment (astrocytes, microglia cells) as well as adjacent cellular structures such as blood-brain-barrier and 
postsynaptic terminals. It comprises cellular processes designated as hallmarks of PD pathogenesis, such as synaptic dysfunction, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein degradation, neuropathobiology of aggregated proteins, or neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>The PD map can be easily explored via an intuitive “Google map” layout also on tablets and smartphones. It offers free access 
to diverse research-facilitating functionalities: relevant annotation and links to scientific databases, overlay of experimental 
data, or identification of drug targets and chemical interactions by dedicated interfaces.</p>

### Community curation (domain experts: clinicians, biologists)

<p>We encourage the PD community to join forces and support this project by integrating their expertise to continuously refine and expand the knowledge within the PD map. To support that, feedback functions are integrated into the PD map and hands-on workshops with domain experts are regularly organized. </p>
