<h1>Guidelines</h1>

<p>In each case, a disease map is designed while taking into account the goals and objectives of a particular project, 
specifics of disease conditions and disease subtypes. Here we propose a set of guidelines for a disease map construction 
and define some concepts that are derived from our collective experience and that might be helpful for developing a new disease map.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Form a panel of domain experts: leading researchers, clinicians and biologist, with experience in the field of this particular disorder.</li>
<li>Define the scope of a disease map. What are the disease hallmarks? What are the key modules? What levels of granularity should be included?</li>
<li>Develop an overview map and start determining the content in close communication with the domain experts.</li>
<li>Develop a draft version reusing information from other disease maps and pathway databases.</li>
<li>Develop a comprehensive version.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps can be done in parallel.</p>

<h3>Proposed milestones</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>6 months:</strong> Steps 1-3 are progressed simultaneously. An overview diagram is developed and improved.  
The results are used for drafting the first publication on the resource. 
A logical model can be developed for this high-level view.</li>
<li><strong>18 months:</strong> The first version of a map is developed. 
Pathway databases and other disease maps are to be used where possible in order to minimise the time necessary for 
developing a detailed comprehensive view.</li>
<li><strong>36 months:</strong> Refined version is complete and made accessible online for browsing, data interpretation 
and hypothesis generation, new disease-specific pathway modules are developed from scratch where necessary.</li>
</ul>
