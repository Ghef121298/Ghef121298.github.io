# Guidelines

The provided guidelines are based on our collective experience of building representations of disease mechanisms, the work by Maria Kondratova and coauthors (Kondratova et al., 2018, PMID 29688383), descriptions of [published disease maps]([publications](publications#disease-maps)) and [comprehensive pathway maps](publications#comprehensive-pathway-maps).  

In each case, a resource is designed while taking into account the goals and objectives of a particular project, specifics of disease conditions and disease subtypes.  


### Map developement steps

The following order of tasks is shown to be efficient in published and ongoing projects.  

PLANNING

1. Pre-development stage: an initial scan of the relevant literature by searching PubMed.  
2. Forming a panel of domain experts: leading researchers (clinicians and biologist) knowledgeable in the field of the disease.  
3. Determining the scope of the disease map: identifying disease hallmarks, key modules to include and the desired granularity that suits the project.  
4. Designing the architecture of the map.  

CURATION

5. Developing an overview map and start determining the content in close communication with the domain experts. An overview map outlines the main modules that are to be included and essentially reviews the future content of the detailed representation of disease mechanisms.  
6. Developing the first version of the map reusing information from other disease maps and pathway databases as much as possible to speed up the process of map construction.  

PUBLISHING ONLIE

7. Making the map accessible via publishing it in one of the online map navigation platforms.  
8. Collecting feedback and regularly updating the map.

APPLYING

9. Applying map for network-based andlysis, data visualisation, data interpretation, hypothesis generation, computational modelling


### Standards

We aim at making maps available in various formats including [SBGN](http://sbgn.org) (Systems Biology Graphical Notation), [SBML](http://sbml.org) (Systems Biology Markup Language) and  [BioPAX](http://www.biopax.org) (Biological Pathway Exchange), and also in the original format of the tool in which the map was developed, for example, the default CellDesigner’s XML format or the yEd Graph Editor's GraphML format.
