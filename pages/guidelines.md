# Guidelines

[Architecture][../architecture]
[Annotation][../annotation]


The provided guidelines are based on our collective experience of building representations of disease mechanisms, the work by Maria Kondratova and coauthors (Kondratova et al., 2018, PMID 29688383), descriptions of [published disease maps](https://disease-maps.org/publications#disease-maps) and [comprehensive pathway maps](/publications#comprehensive-pathway-maps).  

In each case, a resource is designed while taking into account the goals and objectives of a particular project, specifics of disease conditions and disease subtypes.
