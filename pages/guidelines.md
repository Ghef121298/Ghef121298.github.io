# Guidelines

[Designing map architecture][../architecture]  
[Annotation][../annotation]


The provided guidelines are based on our collective experience of building representations of disease mechanisms, the work by Maria Kondratova and coauthors (Kondratova et al., 2018, [PMID:29688383](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29688383/)), descriptions of [published disease maps](https://disease-maps.org/publications#disease-maps) and [comprehensive pathway maps](/publications#comprehensive-pathway-maps).  

In each case, a resource is designed while taking into account the goals and objectives of a particular project, specifics of disease conditions and disease subtypes.  

### Disease map development workflow

PLANNING AND DESIGN  
1. Determining map purpose and type  
2. Defining coverage of biological functions  
3. Choosing a graphical standard and an editor  
4. Designing map architecture  
CURATION  
5. Formalising knowledge from literature and databases  
6. Annotating map entities and interactions  
PUBLISHING ONINE  
7. Visualising in a navigable tool  
APPLICATIONS  
9. Applying the resource for data visualisation, modelling, hypothesis generation
