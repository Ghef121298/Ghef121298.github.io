# Highlights

This page collects disease maps' use cases, success stories of their practical applications such as identifying gaps in knowledge, exploring drug targets, omics and multi-omics data visualisation, network-based analysis, interpretation and hypothesis generation, computational modelling, refining hypothesis and making predictions.


Proposed structure for each story:  
- title (clearly saying how the map was used and for what)  
- some illustration if available
- tags/keywords to put it in an application category like modelling, network analysis, hypothesis generation, experimental validation, etc.  
- short one-paragraph text  
- link to the source (or "manuscript in preparation" with a reference to a talk at the DMCM)
