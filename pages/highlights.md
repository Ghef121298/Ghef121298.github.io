# Highlights

Proposed structure for each story:  
- title (clearly saying how the map was used and for what)  
- tags/keywords to put it in an application category like modelling, network analysis, hypothesis generation, experimental validation, etc.  
- short one-paragraph text  
- link to the source (or "manuscript in preparation" with a reference to a talk at the DMCM)
