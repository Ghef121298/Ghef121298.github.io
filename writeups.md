## Research 

#### Trustzone and Android kernel 
I started to find the linux kernel really interesting then I found the Android kernel even more interesting. So I found a libary which talsk to the trustzone and wanted to see 
how this works and opened it up in Ida and documented what I had found. 

I hope to write more on this as I find this facinating.
