## Research 


### Discussion: What are the challenges facing law enforcement in terms of mobile forensics with ephemeral applications on Android Devices?
Part of a module on mobile forensics at uni, this is what sparked my interest in the Android/Linux kernel
[What are the challenges facing law enforcement in terms of mobile forensics with ephemeral applications on Android Devices? ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/27iouu8lwkcocfg/Discussion_%20What%20are%20the%20challenges%20facing%20law%20enforcement%20in%20terms%20of%20mobile%20forensics%20with%20ephemeral%20applications%20on%20Android%20Devices_.pdf?dl=0)

#### Trustzone and Android kernel 
I find the linux kernel and the android kernel really interesting as a topic, they are an area which I like to read about and see how it all works together.
