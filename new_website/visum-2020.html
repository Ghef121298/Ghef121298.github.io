            <h2>Online VISUM 2020 Highlights</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    From July 3rd to July 10th, I attended the VISUM summer school online. Originally planned to take place in Porto, it was moved online due to the pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The itinerary included lectures, AI shots, and a main competition. The lectures covered topics like machine learning, deep learning, information security, and AI. The AI shots were short 30-minute talks by industry professionals on AI use cases in their work.
                </p>

                <h3>Lecture Highlights</h3>
                <p>
                    Jaime Cardoso (INESC TEC and the University of Porto FEUP) provided a detailed lecture on computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML), covering deep learning, artificial intelligence, and their history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One highlight was professor Johan Suykens’ lecture on Deep Learning and Kernel Machines. He discussed function estimation, LS-SVM, kernel spectral clustering, restricted kernel machines, and generative models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pascal Mettes (University of Amsterdam) gave an engaging talk on action recognition, discussing video representation, zero-shot learning, self-supervised learning, and graph neural networks for action understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professor Nicolas Courty’s talk on Optimal Transport in Deep Learning was equally intriguing, diving into Wasserstein Loss, domain adaptation, and Monge mapping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professor Marta Gomez-Barrero delivered an insightful talk on Information Security, covering cryptography, biometrics, user authentication, and a case study on Cancelable Biometrics Based on Bloom Filters [2].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mauricio Reyes (University of Bern) discussed Interpretability in ML for Medical Imaging, differentiating between explainability and interpretability and emphasizing their importance in medical applications.
                </p>

                <h3>The Competition</h3>
                <p>
                    The most exciting part was the competition. From 70+ participants, we formed teams of three to work on a fish detection problem. Using methodologies like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and transfer learning with pre-trained models, the winning teams achieved results close to the state of the art.
                </p>
