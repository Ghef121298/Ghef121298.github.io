## Implementing Industry 4.0 on manufacturing processes

>This project was a milestone that was as it saved up-to 5,79,600 INR every shift.
>It included detailed analysis of sensors used and connecting them to cloud platform
>

## Structural and Mechanical design of packaging machine sub-system
>A packaging has various station, in order work at its optimum speed each station has to perform at its maximum speed and complete the task appointed efficiently.

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
