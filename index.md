## Latent Dirichlet allocation on job listings

_Published: 30th-Sept-2021_

_Updated: 30th-Sep-2021_

Believing that job listings all contains certain keywords which are specifically written for the profession, in this project, I attempted to use Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to extract the common keywords and themes associated with each job listing, so that we can use an unsupervised approach in classifying each of the job listings into each various themes.

## Tableau Portfolio on taxi data in Chicago

_Published: 5th-Aug-2021_

_Updated: 5th-Aug-2021_

In this project, I used the open data base from Google BigQuery in which I analyzed the market share and market trend for taxi companies in Chicago, by comparing the yearly market share and trends of the individual taxi companies, and the impact of lockdown from the pandemic has had on the taxi companies. I have found the taxi companies have been merging to consolidate resources in these challenging times with much fewer companies today in Chicago than in previous years.

## Real or Not NLP with Disaster Tweets

_Published: 21st-Mar-2020_

A Kaggle Data Science project in which I used feature engineering to pick out features, such as number of punctuation, sentence length etc., in order to build a model in which disaster and non-disaster tweets can be separated. Achieved a Training accuracy of 79% and a Test accuracy of 76% through the use of feature engineering.

## Kaggle Competition Data Science for Good, City of Los Angeles

A Kaggle Data Science project in which we tried to find if the job listing contains any types of biasness. We first parsed the job listings into a dataframe before applying text analytics, in which we attempted to find which job listing contains more masculine words, and which job listing contains more feminine words.
