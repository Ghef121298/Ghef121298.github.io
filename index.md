### Bike Sharing Analysis using Linear Regression
Domain: Transportation | Tech Stack: Python (ML model-Linear Regression)

A US bike-sharing provider ‘BoomBikes’ has suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. ‘BoomBikes’ aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to COVID-19. Therefore, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

The company wants to know:
•	Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
•	How well do those variables describe the bike demands?

Business Goal:
Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. So, they can manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations as well as the model will be a good way for the management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

### Lead Scoring Case Study-(Logistic Regression)
Domain: Education | Tech Stack: Python (ML model-Logistic Regression)

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course, or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.
Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor.

Business Goal:
Required to build a model wherein to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead scores have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead scores have a lower conversion chance. The CEO has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Telecomm Churn Case Study
Domain: Telecomm | Tech Stack: Python (ML model-Logistic Regression)

The Telecomm industry is highly competitive and customers actively switch from one operator to another, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate and it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

Therefore in this project...

A) Need to analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn, and identify the main indicators of churn.

B) Need to define high-value customers based on a certain metric (mentioned later below) and predict churn only on high-value customers.

C) Use the usage-based definition to define churn.
