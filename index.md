<p> <i>D. suzukii</i> is an invasive fruit fly from Southeast Asia that lays it's eggs in ripe fruit, causing extensive crop damage. In 2018, scientist made a comprehensive overview of <i>D. suzukii's</i> global distribution [doi:10.1111/1365-2664.13285]. The compiled data is from over 500 documents and includes information on D. suzukii's ubiquity. </p>

<p> I used this data to visualize the progression of <i>D. suzukii</i>. Each dot is a recorded <i>D. suzukii</i> observation. I then added labels for the date and abundance. </p>
