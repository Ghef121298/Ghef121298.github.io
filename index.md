### Bike Sharing Analysis using Linear Regression
Domain: Transportation | Tech Stack: Python (ML model-Linear Regression)

A US bike-sharing provider ‘BoomBikes’ has suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. ‘BoomBikes’ aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to COVID-19. Therefore, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes? 

How well do those variables describe the bike demands?

Business Goal:

Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. The management will use it to understand how exactly the needs vary with different features. So, they can manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations as well as the model will be a good way for the management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

### Telecomm Churn Case Study
Domain: Telecomm | Tech Stack: Python (ML model-Logistic Regression)

The Telecomm industry is highly competitive and customers actively switch from one operator to another, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate and it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

Therefore in this project...

A) Need to analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn, and identify the main indicators of churn.

B) Need to define high-value customers based on a certain metric (mentioned later below) and predict churn only on high-value customers.

C) Use the usage-based definition to define churn.

### Lead Scoring Case Study-(Logistic Regression)
Domain: Education | Tech Stack: Python (ML model-Logistic Regression)

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses fill up a form for the system, or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified as a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.
Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is inferior.

Business Goal:

Required to build a model wherein to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead scores have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead scores have a lower conversion chance. The CEO has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
Domain: Banking | Tech Stack: Python (ML)

Predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of Machine learning models. Analyse customer-level data that has been collected and analyzed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group. For many banks, retaining highly profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust, and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.

### Finance and Risk Analytics for Portfolio Management (Capstone)
Domain: Finance | Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit

The industry of wealth management has seen a lot of growth. Individuals and businesses actively seek maximum returns. However, in many cases, they lack either the skills to identify the right investment opportunities or the time to find such opportunities. This challenge gave rise to the dedicated individuals who perform this task on behalf of the investors for a commission: portfolio managers. A portfolio manager makes investment decisions and carries out other related activities on behalf of vested investors.	Help to understand stock's closing price, normalize closing price, daily returns, compare with other stocks, their distributions, and a few more parameters per the requirement of Portfolio Management. Provide consultation to two different investors, Mr. Patrick Jyenger and Mr. Peter Jyenger based on their requirements and financial objectives.

### Identify Entities in Healthcare for ‘BeHealthy’ using NER (Named Entity Recognition) 
Domain: Health | Tech Stack: Python (NER)

Companies like ‘BeHealthy’ are providing medical services, prescriptions, and online consultations and generating huge data day by day. Therefore, to find out the disease and its probable treatment from the given dataset and store it in the form of a table or a dictionary is necessary to make it easier for non-medical background people. After analyzing the problem need to build a custom NER to get the list of diseases and their treatment from the data set.
