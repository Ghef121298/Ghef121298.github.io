### Detecting Effusions in Chest X-Ray Images Using Neural Networks

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/subham0206)

This project leverages neural networks to analyze Chest X-Ray (CXR) images for identifying "effusion" (fluid in the lungs) versus 'nofinding' (normal). Key steps included standardizing image resolution, applying morphological operations, normalization, and augmentation for data pre-processing. The model was built using AUC as the evaluation metric and incorporated weighted cross-entropy to handle class imbalance.

Thorough experiments were conducted, including ablation studies and hyperparameter tuning. The final model achieved 90% accuracy and 88% AUC, with significant improvements in the ROC curve due to the use of weighted cross-entropy. Technologies used include numpy, pathlib, ResNet, keras, and tensorflow.

The CNN-based model I constructed accurately detects melanoma, a type of skin cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, which can be deadly if not detected early. An automated solution that evaluates images and alerts dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to significantly reduce manual diagnostic efforts. The model achieved accuracy of 90% after addressing class imbalance through data augmentation. Technologies used include numpy, skimage, keras and tensorflow. The project steps involved data reading and understanding, dataset creation and visualization, model building and training, analyzing model overfit/underfit, applying data augmentation to resolve class imbalances, and training a final CNN model to accurately detect nine classes of melanoma.

### Revolutionizing Customer Support: AI Model Uncovers True Drivers Behind Support Tickets

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/subham0206/Customer-Support-Ticket-Classification.git)

Addressing challenges with unreliable CRM fields, our project focused on accurately classifying customer support tickets using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging the Customer Support Ticket Dataset from Kaggle, we utilized Python to preprocess and analyze the data, achieving a notable 92% accuracy in ticket classification.

By implementing both unsupervised topic modeling and supervised classification approaches across 50 predefined topics, we uncovered key insights into global customer support trends. These insights were visualized in Power BI, providing interactive dashboards for stakeholders to navigate and understand ticket drivers effectively.

This initiative not only enhances operational efficiency but also empowers global contact centers with actionable insights for informed decision-making and improved customer service delivery.

### Bike Sharing Demand Problem

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/subham0206/Bike-Sharing-Assigment.git)

Build a Multiple linear regression model to solve bike sharing problem for a company. We are required to build a shared bikes demand model with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

### Lending Club CaseStudy

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/subham0206/LendingClubCaseStudy.git)

Lending company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. This is an assignment provided by IIT B Upgrad program, It will give an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques i have learnt in EDA, I have also developed a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
The dataset is obtained from lending club portal. It contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
