Hello there!

I'm a PhD candidate at the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM). I am part of Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) research group at Queen Mary University of London. 

My research interest is mainly Optial Music Recogntion as well as other MIR related subfields. My goal is to have computers read sheet music computationally. I started working in this problem in September 2019 when I was granted the studentship from QMUL and Steinberg GmBH with which we collaborate closely. 

My work focuses on how can we bring new machine learning solutions to the field of OMR and achieve an end-to-end solution to the problem.

## Teaching

### Machine Learning (Postgraduate)
The aim of the module is to give students an understanding of machine learning methods, including pattern recognition, clustering and neural networks, and to allow them to apply such methods in a range of areas.

### Machine Learning for Visual Data Analysis (Postgraduate)
The module will cover the following topics: The Discrete Fourier Transform and the frequency content of images. The design and use of Gabor filters. Principal Component Analysis for denoising and compression. Unsupervised classification via feature space clustering. Texture segmentation with Gabor filters.
