## About

Greetings traveller!

I'm a curious mind, technophile and self-taught programmer!
Currently, I'm a Computer Engineering senior student at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), hoping to graduate this Spring with a track in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence!

I'm also a member of [Data Horde](https://datahorde.org/), a community blog dedicated to digital archiving.

I get around quite a bit, below are some of the other places you may have spotted me before landing on this homepage.

## Gamedev

#### Organization:

I co-hosted [Stranger Jam (19-26 June 2020)](https://itch.io/jam/strangerjam2020). In Stranger Jam participants were only allowed to team up with people they hadn't met before, hence people who were complete "strangers". Stranger Jam was a unique twist on the usual game jam formula, allowing participants to collaborate with new people, instead of only competing against one another.

19 games were submitted by over 40 participants. A [playthrough of Stranger Jam](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjG0A3RTjh1Ti58VQ9hNe1alV4P7opc-N) submissions is available as a YouTube Playlist, courtesy of *The Wandering Shadow*.

#### Collaborations:
* [A Little Planet Called Chokka](https://efegiller.itch.io/a-little-planet-called-chokka)(LOWREZJAM 2019)
* [Le Bouc Émissaire](https://efegiller.itch.io/le-bouc-emissaire)

#### Solo Games:
* [Here, Fishy Fishy!](https://themadprogramer.itch.io/here-fishy-fishy)(Ludum Dare 46 Compo)

## Competitive Programming

* I used to compete on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/themadprogramer) and [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/themadpr0gramer).
* Nowadays, I am trying get into Data Science, so I'm much more active on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/themadprogramer).

## Q&A

* I spend a lot of time on Stack Exchange. I'm most active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2089784/madprogramer) and [Linguistics](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/17465/madprogramer).

* I also write on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ahmet-Akko%C3%A7-%E7%99%BD%E7%BE%8A-%E9%98%BF%E8%B5%AB%E9%BA%A6%E5%BE%B7) from time to time. Most notably I administer the [Cult of Linguists](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/17465/madprogramer) Group.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
