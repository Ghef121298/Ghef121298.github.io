## Latent Dirichlet allocation on job listings

_Published: 30th-Sept-2021_

_Updated: 30th-Sep-2021_

Believing that job listings all contains certain keywords which are specifically written for the profession, in this project, I attempted to use Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to extract the common keywords and themes associated with each job listing, so that we can use an unsupervised approach in classifying each of the job listings into each various themes.

## Tableau Portfolio on taxi data in Chicago

_Published: 5th-Aug-2021_
_Updated: 5th-Aug-2021_

In this project, I used the open data base from Google BigQuery in which I analyzed the market share and market trend for taxi companies in Chicago, by comparing the yearly market share and trends of the individual taxi companies, and the impact of lockdown from the pandemic has had on the taxi companies. I have found the taxi companies have been merging to consolidate resources in these challenging times with much fewer companies today in Chicago than in previous years.
