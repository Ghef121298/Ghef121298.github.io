### About

I am now a second-year PhD student at [UMSI](https://www.si.umich.edu/), where I am co-advised by Prof.[Misha Teplitskiy](https://www.misha.mx/) and Prof.[David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/). 

I study science of science and innovation and I am currently interested in global disparities in science and knowledge transfer within the science community. 

Previously, I received my M.S. in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and my B.S. in mechatronics engineering from Zhejiang University. After a circuitous journey, like solving a non-convex optimization problem, I unlock the thrill of [computational social science](https://css.si.umich.edu/index.html) research. 

Now when I’m not playing with data, you can find me blazing the kitchen, searching for misplaced goggles, or honing my barista skills for a backup career plan.

See my [CV](assets/HongChen_CV.pdf) for papers and links.

### Failed projects

Failure is an unavoidable aspect of life, including in the field of science. As a researcher studying science of science, I find it intriguing to explore the knowledge that remains hidden in file drawers. As a member of the scientific community, I believe it is a public good to share our experiences and insights from these setbacks, as it can benefit others and advance scientific knowledge.

This part is inspired by [Jemery Yang](https://jeremyzyang.github.io/)'s personal website, where he shares his experiences with projects that didn't work out despite his serious efforts. While I may not have done as many projects as some, I wanna share my works that do not have led to publishing success, but still hold valuable lessons and insights.
	
#### Collaboration Behavior and Rising Citation Inequality

This project started during my gap year back in China when I got a research position in PKU. I started to learn science of science, scientometric more specifically.
This study analyzes the publication records in Microsoft Academic Graph dataset to study the rising citation inequality among scientists. The coauthorship networks are analyzed to understand the accumulative advantage of top cited authors in the context of collaboration behaviors. A model is proposed to explain the observed features and trends.

#### Network Evolution in Scholar Communication of CRISPR Gene Editing

This project was my first major foray into computational social science, outside of a course project. It began during my first summer in Pittsburgh, a time when my life and the world as a whole was undergoing significant change due to the pandemic. This project aims to explore how people's perceptions of a technological innovation are shaped by scientific and ethical uncertainties. We start from available text data from PubMed and try to see how researchers talk about scientific innovation. Our study employs a text network approach to analyze the semantic structure of publications about the gene-editing technology. Specifically, we aim to capture the evolution of ethically sensitive language in scholarly communication, providing insights into how these concerns have shifted over time.
