### NG USFP-Performance Testing Project 

The main Objective Measure the performance of the individual identified business processes in sequential manner against pre-defined SLA’s/NFR’s with normal user load per business scenario and measure the performance of the solution and the associated infrastructure against pre-defined SLA’s/NFR’s (E2E and component/application level) under normal and peak loads.

#### GE Health Care BACOE Performance Testing Project

The main objective of this Project was to check whether the applications and the related components would be able to perform reliably and as per the expectations under heavy loads of quarter/year-end close. The expectations, simply put, the database server should be able to handle the expected Business transactions along with the Concurrent jobs, Appworx chains, interfaces, and extracts. 
The technology used in GLPROD (11i) was Oracle Applications 11.5.10.2 running on Oracle 10g as the database server and Sun OS 5.10 sun4u sparc SUNW.
And, the technology used in BIOPROD (R12) was Oracle Applications 11.2.0.3.0 running on Oracle 10g as the database server and SunOS erp-ora-stg-02 5.10 Generic_144488-03 sun4u sparc SUNW.
Client/Server load balancing was implemented across the web and form servers. The system was load tested using a third party tool called HP Load Runner version 11.03 from HP; the transactions were recorded and correspondingly correlated to do dynamic load balancing. HTTP/S was used to enable secure transfer of data over SSL for some of the web pages.
