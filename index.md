## Reporting Portfolio 

<h3 align="center"> <i>Drosophila suzukii</i>'s global distribution</h3>
<i>D. suzukii</i> is an invasive fruit fly from East and Southeast Asia that lays its eggs in ripe fruit, causing extensive crop damage. In 2018, scientists provided a comprehensive overview of <i>D. suzukii's</i> global distribution [Ørsted and  Ørsted, 2018](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13285). The compiled data are from over 500 documents and include information on <i>D. suzukii's</i> rapid global spread I used this data to visualize the progression of <i>D. suzukii</i>.

<h3 align="center"> Interactive map of <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> global distribution with collection information</h3>
<p>  Each observation includes information on an observation date and on the abundance of collection. To view additional information, I created an interactive html document. Country names can be viewed when hovering, and labels for <i>D. suzukii's</i> observation date and abundance can be viewed when clicking on an individual dot. </p>

<h3 align="center"> Three Years of COVID-19 in New York City</h3>
At the beginning of 2020, a new virus (SARS-CoV-2) spread worldwide, causing a global pandemic. COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, quickly spread through New York City (NYC). To inform public health decisions, NYC officials tracked the case and death rate and publicized their data. I downloaded all the data from [NYC - github](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data) and created the following figures.

## Selected graphics from science communication projects and PH.D. thesis project
The following graphics was created for Natural Selections, a newspaper at The Rockefeller university.

For the following graphics, I present the expression (TPM) of 15 genes of interest that were significantly differentially expressed in my RNA-sequencing analysis. For the analysis, I compared the expression rate (how often a gene is transcribed) of different genes between four fly species.

Fly icons and blueprints for a behavior chamber designed for my thesis project.

Below, I plotted the spike rate of a neuron recorded with single sensillum electrophysiology over time. Neurons spike in response to external stimuli, and the spike rate can be recorded using electrophysiology. Each trace shows the spiking activity of a single fly neuron. The bold colored line is the average of all traces.
