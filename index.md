 IoT is networking of physical devices and computers which enables them to collect and share data. The collected data is usually aggregated and stored on cloud platforms. IoT allows remote sensing and monitoring of these devices. This internetworking and connectivity is allowing automation in various fields. One such great example is that of industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT enabled manufacturing systems enable monitoring of vital machine data and controlling the machine using various signals. This helps to improve the manufacturing process and helps to plan maintenance activities of the machines.
