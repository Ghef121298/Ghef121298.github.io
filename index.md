**Neural Machine Translation:** An NMT system which translates texts from Spanish to English using a Bidirectional LSTM encoder for the source sentence and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder with multiplicative attention for the target sentence ([GitHub]()).

**Dependency Parsing:** A Neural Transition-Based Dependency Parsing system with one-layer MLP ([GitHub]()).

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
