Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning deploys a machine learning (ML) model and an example dataset of credit card transactions to train the model to recognize fraud patterns. The model is self-learning which enables it to adapt to new, unknown fraud patterns.

Use this Guidance to automate the detection of potentially fraudulent activity, and the flagging of that activity for review. Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning is easy to deploy and includes an example dataset but you can modify the code to work with any dataset.

Overview
Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning allows you to run automated transaction processing on an example dataset or your own dataset. The included ML model detects potentially fraudulent activity and flags that activity for review. The diagram below presents the architecture you can build using the example code on GitHub.
