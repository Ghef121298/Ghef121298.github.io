Hello there!

I'm a PhD candidate at the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM). I am part of Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) research group at Queen Mary University of London. 

My research interest is mainly Optial Music Recogntion as well as other MIR related subfields. My goal is to have computers read sheet music computationally. I started working in this problem in September 2019 when I was granted the studentship from QMUL and Steinberg GmBH with which we collaborate closely. 

My work focuses on how can we bring new machine learning solutions to the field of OMR and achieve an end-to-end solution to the problem.

## DoReMi Dataset
We recently published our DoReMi dataset at the [3rd International Workshop on Reading Music Systems 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/worms2021/home). We made our dataset available in [this page](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/DoReMi/releases/tag/v1.0) open for anyone to use it, experiment with it and maybe suggesting new ways to represent these data.  

Documentation is also availabe in the same repository of the data release.

## Teaching

### Machine Learning (Postgraduate) 2020
The aim of the module is to give students an understanding of machine learning methods, including pattern recognition, clustering and neural networks, and to allow them to apply such methods in a range of areas.

### Machine Learning for Visual Data Analysis (Postgraduate) 2021
The module will cover the following topics: The Discrete Fourier Transform and the frequency content of images. The design and use of Gabor filters. Principal Component Analysis for denoising and compression. Unsupervised classification via feature space clustering. Texture segmentation with Gabor filters.

### RMRI Research Methods and Responsible Methods (Postgraduate) 2020

This module will teach generic high-level research and transferable skills applicable to pure and applied research in computer science and engineering. The module fosters the development of practical understanding of established approaches, methods and techniques of research; conceptual understanding that enables critical and rigorous evaluation of research; ability to communicate ideas and conclusions logically and fluently in both written and oral contexts.
