The project aims to build a CNN-based model for accurately detecting melanoma, a type of skin cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, which can be deadly if not detected early. An automated solution that evaluates images and alerts dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to significantly reduce manual diagnostic efforts. The model achieved accuracy of 90% after addressing class imbalance through data augmentation. Technologies used include numpy, skimage, keras and tensorflow. The project steps involved data reading and understanding, dataset creation and visualization, model building and training, analyzing model overfit/underfit, applying data augmentation to resolve class imbalances, and training a final CNN model to accurately detect nine classes of melanoma.

Build a Multiple linear regression model to solve bike sharing problem for a company. We are required to build a shared bikes demand model with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

Lending company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. This is an assignment provided by IIT B Upgrad program, It will give an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques i have learnt in EDA, I have also developed a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
The dataset is obtained from lending club portal. It contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
