Third edition of The International Workshop on Reading Music Systems (WoRMS) was held in a hybrid live/virtual setting last Friday 23rd of July. It brough together many researchers working in Optical Music Recogntion (OMR) and also from the industry. This edition 11 papers researching a broad list of topics in OMR were presented and a wonderful keynote from Anthony Wilkes (Organum Ltd) talking on The design of ReadScoreLib. 

Below I will try to summarise some of the papers presnted. 

[Hybrid Annotation Systems for Music Transcription by Ioannis Petros Samiotis, Christoph Lofi and Alessandro Bozzon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17BdTUfU6Fk8qyrpxo6L-BGTqIhLvStL5/view)

Dwells on the idea of bringing human annotation and automated methods together for music transcription. In other words how can a non-specialist carry out music transcription with careful task interaction using AI automated methods. Among 144 workers that excecuted taks in MTurk, those with formal knowledge in music were rare. Audio extracts of target music scores were offered to increase performance, espeially for short segments of one or two measures. For longer segments audio extracts have shown better results against textual measures, but a combiniation of the two was used as more preferable. 


[Implementation and evaluation of a neural network for the recognition of handwritten melodies by Nils Wenzlitschke](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Dp9gIjQPZVwSFJzKK8QA6Xjcgv894wj/view)

This research came as a fruit of a current need of digital archiving and digitalization of music for the
University Library of Regensburg. It evaluates if existing SOTA deep learning architecture is able to recognise handwritten monophonic scores for the purpose of digitalisation. The architecture presented, based on existing work, includes two neural networks: stave recognition network using autoecnoders and an end-to-end note recogntion using convolutional recurrent networks. One limitation mentioned is the amount of annotated data available for this research. 


[DoReMi: First glance at a universal OMR dataset by Elona Shatri and George Fazekas	](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07786&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=14810089764046134622&ei=zZr-YJCFNYqImgHdz7SYBQ&scisig=AAGBfm3Isc8XU8MWS1mRRgnn5ctiET7y8g)

We were also part of this workshop presenting our work in our newly published dataset DoReMi.
